# Quest Clicker
Travel through multiple worlds as you embark on endless amounts of quests, slaying monsters and recruiting new friends.
Gain combos by attacking multiple times in a row to gain extra power, gold, and more. Purchase abilities such as 
Thor's Hammer and Golden Finger to help you reach your goal. Don't forget to upgrade your friends as they can gain buffs 
to improve everyone! Your hero will need to eventually settle down and retire, but fear not. Your child
can use their inheritance to purchase artifacts that will make them even stronger than last time. So what are you
waiting for? Head on over to the [open alpha](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.tophattiger.questclicker.android)
to become a tester and receive updates as I improve upon the game! If you want to see what's in the works, check out the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/r3O9ZZ5n/quest-clicker).

##About the Developer
Hey, name's Collin. Freshmen year of college I was addicted to mobile rpgs and couldn't get enough. I noticed reoccurring
parts that I loved in the games but also the parts that made the game unenjoyable or that were obviously
missing. To solve this problem, I figured I'd create my own game exactly as I envisioned the perfect tap rpg to be.
During the summer of 2015 I created the main parts of the game using Android Studio and a library called Libgdx. All of
the artwork, if you can call it that, and code other than the library were made solely by me. This has been my first 
attempt at creating a game and plan to finish it through to market. I've been able to experience many different
roles througout this project and can now fully understand the usefullness of an entire team working on a game
and not only one person. I've learned so much throughout this process that I can't wait to start on my next game which 
I know will turn out even better and more efficient.
